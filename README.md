# prfVista
A small respository to call pRF functions in vistasoft without the need to set up vistasoft-specific data structures and session files. The assumption is that the fMRI time series are in MATLAB format, and the stimulus file is also in MATLAB format.

This requires the vistasoft tools on the paths. The code for this repository and all of its dependencies can be added to the Matlab path using the [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox) configuration file: [prfVista](https://github.com/WinawerLab/ToolboxRegistry/blob/master/configurations/prfVista.json).

See [rmMain.m](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft/blob/master/mrBOLD/Analysis/retinotopyModel/rmMain.m) for more details.
